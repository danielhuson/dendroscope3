{"name":"Dendroscope","tagline":"Dendroscope - a program for analyzing and visualizing rooted phylogenetic trees and networks","body":"### Dendroscope\r\nDendroscope is a Java program for working with rooted phylogenetic trees and networks. It provides a number of methods for drawing and comparing rooted phylogenetic networks, and for computing them from rooted trees. The program can be used interactively or in command-line mode. Installers for all 3 major operating systems can be downloaded from [www.dendroscope.org](http://www.dendroscope.org).\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nMost of the code was written by Daniel Huson (@danielhuson) as part of his research as Professor of Algorithms in Bioinformatics at the University of Tuebingen. Some code was contributed by Celine Scornavacca, Benjamin Albrecht, Leo van Iersel, Phillippe Gambette and some students (see the source files for details).\r\n\r\n### Publication\r\nThe software is described in:\r\nHuson D.H. and C.
